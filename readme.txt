Add WordPress sourcecode tags with the click of a button.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a button (icon: S) that adds WordPress's sourcecode tags to selected text. Just click the button, enter the code language, and you're done!

You can change the row of your TinyMCE editor that the button appears in in Settings > Src Tag Adder.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `sourcecode-tag-adder` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Visit the settings page in Settings > Src Tag Adder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I format the code language name? =

You don't need to. The plugin will remove spaces, and make everything lowercase. However, you must use the most popular version of the language's name. For example, 'JavaScript' will work, but 'JS' will not. 'PHP' will work, 'PHP: Hypertext Processor' will not.

== Screenshots ==

1. The button as it appears in the TinyMCE editor.
2. The popup prompt that asks for the code language.
